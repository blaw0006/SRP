upload the trained models??? Or just leave locally, tell them where it is and how to train the model themselves.

Recording
- check they are connected with arecord -l
- using audio_capture
- using record.launch and record_node (check the labels and stuff)

Experimental setup

Training models
- need to download PANNS model from here: ____ separately, due to the size of the file
- using runme.sh
- changing the output layer to fit your model
- using inference.sh

Note: trained models are not on the github due to filesize limitations, they are on the UR5 PC
